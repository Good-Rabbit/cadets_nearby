# Cadets Nearby

A flutter project for finding nearby ex/cadets in Bangladesh.

## Platforms
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-3DDC84?style=for-the-badge&logo=android&logoColor=white)]()

## Target

To create a free platform for finding ex/cadets who are nearby.
This is to try to reduce the distance between us and build a cooperative community.
A platform open to implement anything we might require.
Hope this project will help us reap the benefits of technology.

## For those who want to help

You can create an issue for bugs or feature requests.
I will try my best to implement those.
Testing the pre-release versions for bugs will also be helpful, or just check out progress by installing the test version of the android app from the releases section.

If you are a developer and want to help the growth of this project, feel free to contribute.
Any support is highly appreciated

You can also buy me a coffee.
